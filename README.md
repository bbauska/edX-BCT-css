edX's Introductory Course on CSS.

Welcome to this introductory course on CSS!

CSS, or "Cascading Style Sheets," is the most fundamental tool web developers use to style a web page. On its own, CSS doesn't do anything, but in conjunction with HTML and other technologies, CSS is the key to visually interesting, interactive, and engaging web apps.

In this course, we'll introduce you to the fundamentals of CSS, teach you how to style basic HTML elements, and provide hands-on experience in styling existing web pages. We'll define some of the vocabulary every developer needs to know, and dissect CSS code together so you can better understand what every line is trying to accomplish.

After completing this course, you'll be able to:

Style HTML elements using CSS selectors

Link CSS stylesheets to HTML files

Annotate
