edX's Introductory Course on CSS.

Welcome to this introductory course on CSS!

CSS, or "Cascading Style Sheets," is the most fundamental tool web developers use to style a web page. On its own, CSS doesn't do anything, but in conjunction with HTML and other technologies, CSS is the key to visually interesting, interactive, and engaging web apps.

In this course, we'll introduce you to the fundamentals of CSS, teach you how to style basic HTML elements, and provide hands-on experience in styling existing web pages. We'll define some of the vocabulary every developer needs to know, and dissect CSS code together so you can better understand what every line is trying to accomplish.

After completing this course, you'll be able to:

Style HTML elements using CSS selectors

Link CSS stylesheets to HTML files

# System Requirements

To complete the activities in this course, you’ll need a desktop or laptop computer that runs Windows, macOS, or Linux. You’ll also need to download some other software tools: Google Chrome and VS Code. The sections below explain how to download and install these software systems, so you can use them in the boot camp.

Google Chrome
Chrome is the web browser you’ll use to determine whether your code is working correctly. Google Chrome has various tools that make it an ideal platform for coding, so consider switching your browser to Chrome if you haven't already.

Installation Guide (Windows & Mac)
If you haven’t installed it already, download Google Chrome.
Download, open, and run the installation file.
VS Code
VS (Visual Studio) Code is a powerful program with many advanced capabilities, but for our purposes, it’s a free text editor that helps you create code in a more intuitive way. The fundamental function of programming is to create text in files using various extensions. VS Code provides a visual interpretation of code by identifying the file extensions you include. It does this by recognizing blocks of text as code and using coloring, smart tabs, and an autocomplete functionality to make coding through text more intuitive and accurate. Here’s what a block of HTML text looks like:

And here is an example of code open in VS Code:

Installation Guide (Windows)
Go to the setup page on the VS Code website and select Windows as your platform.

Click “Visual Studio Code installer” in Step 1 under the Installation heading.

Open and run the installer file.

Follow the installation prompts. When you reach the screen shown below, select the highlighted settings (every option listed under Other) and click Next.

This graphic is a screenshot showing the installation options for setting up VS Code. It shows a Windows dialog box where all checkboxes except "Create a desktop icon" are selected, and red arrows and a red box showing you to click "Next."
When the installation is complete, you should be able to access VS Code from your Start menu.

Installation Guide (Mac)
Go to the setup page on the VS Code website and select MacOS as your platform.

Click the link in the installation instructions to Download Visual Studio Code

Open your Downloads folder and double click on the file to unzip.

Drag the file to your Applications folder, as depicted in the following image:

This graphic is a screenshot of a window in a Mac "Downloads" folder. It shows a red box around the "Visual Studio Code" file and a red box around the "Applications" folder, with an arrow pointing from the first to the second.
Access VS Code from your Application folder, as the followings image shows:

This graphic is a screenshot of a window in a Mac "Applications" folder. It shows multiple applications, with a red box around the "Visual Studio Code" thumbnail to show you that the VS Code program is located in your "Applications" folder.
Note: If you're using macOS, you may receive a security warning that won't allow you to open VS Code when you click on it. You can disregard this warning. To open VS Code, right-click on it in your Applications folder and select Open.

Open in Browser
You'll soon learn that you can incorporate free VS Code add-ons to make the process of coding even easier than before. For now, we recommend only installing one extension with VS Code: Open in Browser. This extension will allow you to open HTML files you're editing in VS Code in your web browser without having to go through File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac).

Installation Guide (Windows & Mac)
Open VS Code.

Open the extensions pane and search for "open in browser".

Select the version written by TechER and click Install, as shown in the following image:
